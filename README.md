# Ordinal Regression PyTorch Hub



This is a GitHub repository containing some deep learning models for ordinal regression (with pre-trained weights) in the PyTorch Hub / Torch Hub format. Note that this repository is not going to be a comprehensive Hub for ordinal regression models but more of a way to quickly access models from a specific manuscript:

- Xintong Shi, Wenzhi Cao, and Sebastian Raschka 
  *Deep Neural Networks for Rank-Consistent Ordinal Regression Based On Conditional Probabilities.* [https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08851](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08851) 

(More models may be added later, but I don't want to make any promises ðŸ˜….)

## Using the Models





## Which Models Are Currently Supported







## Training

In case you want to reproduce the model training, you can find the respective instructions and files in the [`_train`](./_train) subfolder.
